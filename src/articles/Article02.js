                If you've read any personal finance advice, you know there's one simple rule that comes up time and again: You need a budget. A budget is a roadmap for where your money will go so you can make your hard-earned income work for you. Budgets assign your money a job and establish spending limits for specific expenditures so you can use your money responsibly. 
                Creating a personalized budget is essential to developing the right spending habits, setting aside money for the long term, and ensuring the money in your bank account goes where it needs to. But how do you make a budget?
                Getting started with your first budget may seem complicated, but this Budgeting 101 article will walk you through every step in the process. You'll learn how to budget, how to avoid common budgeting mistakes, and how to ensure your budget is one you can actually stick to.

                1. Determine why you want a budget 
                </p>

                According to surveys, only around a third of all households live by a strict budget. By deciding to budget, you're joining a select minority -- and your decision will pay off. Budgeters are almost twice as likely to report no financial worries compared with spenders, and they're less likely to live paycheck to paycheck or struggle with finances. 
                While budgeting is always a great decision, it's good to define goals before you start the process, since the reasons you're budgeting may impact choices you make during the process.

                2. Do a deep dive into current spending habits
                </p>
                <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800 m-32 text-justify">
                Before you can create a realistic budget, you need to know what your current spending habits are. If your budget isn't realistic, it's nothing more than a wishlist.
                You won't know if your budget is realistic until you've got an idea of where your money is currently going. Most experts recommend tracking your spending for about 30 days to get a clear picture of spending.
                You can enter your expenses into a spreadsheet or notebook, use an app or use your bank/credit card statements.

                3. Use a calendar to catch irregular expenses

                <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800 m-32 text-justify">
                While tracking spending shows you where money goes on a day-to-day basis, your budget should also factor in funds for irregular expenses, such as holidays and birthdays.
                Americans who borrowed to cover holiday costs took on over $1,000 in new debt during the 2017 season, according to a Magnify Money survey. Half of those who borrowed would still be repaying holiday debt at least three months later. By budgeting throughout the year, you'll never get into holiday debt again.

                4. Add up all of your income

                Budgeting is about making the best use of income, so you need to know how much money you have coming in.
                If your income is variable, one of the best budgeting approaches is to pay yourself a salary. This means you'll decide on a monthly "salary" to base your budget around and when extra money comes in, save it in case of a bad month later. The monthly income you choose as your salary could be based off what you earn on average, or what you'd typically earn in a bad month if you want to build a bigger cushion and reduce the risk of overspending.  
                Those with irregular incomes could also live off last month's income, updating their budget each month based on what they earned the month prior -- but this is a more labor-intensive approach.

                5. Identify your personalized financial goals
                </p>
                <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800 m-32 text-justify">
                Most people who make a budget do so because they want to accomplish more with their money. When you set goals, you can align your budget around achieving them by deciding how much you need to set aside to accomplish each goal. Goal setting has been shown repeatedly by studies to increase motivation and achievement. 
                Setting goals is the single most crucial part of making a budget. If you don't use your budget to make sure you're working toward goals, all you're doing is shifting spending and you'll still have nothing to show for your money in the end.

                6. Decide how much to save
                </p>
                <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800 m-32 text-justify">
                Once you've got your financial goals, decide how much you need to save for each goal. If you want $100,000 for a house down payment in five years, save $1,666 monthly. If you want to build a $1,000 emergency fund by next year, save $83.33 a month. If you want to pay off $5,000 in debt at 10% interest by the end of the year, make $440 in monthly payments. 
                he more specific you can be about how much to dedicate to each goal, the more likely you'll achieve it. But if you don't want to go through this whole exercise, take a shortcut and make a plan to save at least 20% of your income. You can devote 15% to retirement savings and the rest toward other goals.

                7. Schedule a household meeting 
                </p>

                If you're single, you don't have to worry about getting anyone else on board. But if you have a life partner, budgeting is a team project.
                Money is a leading cause of relationship stress, with 35% of couples in a SunTrust Bank survey citing money as the cause. If you aren't on the same page, your attempts to budget may be thwarted when your spouse hits the mall or splurges on Super Bowl tickets -- and this is bound to cause strife.
                It's important to have a state-of-the-union meeting even if you maintain separate finances so your partner will understand why your spending habits may change and how he or she can support your efforts. </p>

                8. Choose a tool to make your budget
                </p>
                <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800 m-32 text-justify">
                The next step is to decide on the logistics of creating your budget. The sample budget above was made in a simple Excel spreadsheet and this approach can be a great one because you don't need to download any special apps or learn any new programs.
                If you want a tool that will allow you to automatically see if you're on budget, there are plenty of apps you can use.</p>
